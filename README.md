## Overview

The purpose of building this website was to solidify my learning with React and to make use of the [backend](https://github.com/ryan-jm/gamecritic) I had created a few weeks prior. I decided to utilise TypeScript for this project because I wanted to test my ability to pick up and learn new tech quickly (as I will be doing when on-the-job fulltime.)

**Concepts I have learned from this project:**

- How to create stateful single-page-applications utilising React.

- How to incorporate context and create my own custom hooks.

- The benefits of strict typing.

- How to _attempt_ to stay organised when working with large scope.

- Hosting with [GitHub Pages](https://ryan-jm.github.io/gamecritic-frontend/).

- Incorporating JWTs within a frontend and utilising them with an API.
